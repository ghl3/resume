        \begin{itemize}
        \item Wrote a web app using a probabilistic recommendation algorithm to suggest nearby restaurants and bars \\
        \item Used python, numpy, and scipy to build a markov chain based on latent semantic analysis \\
        \item Used MongoDB to store data obtained via public api's and web scraping \\
        \item Developed on the web using Flask, Bootstrap, and jquery and deployed on heroku \\

        \medskip

        \begin{itemize}
        \item Primary developer of statistical modeling and analysis software used extensively throughout our experiment
        \item Used parallel analysis architecture to analyze petabytes of data distributed over a worldwide grid of datacenters
        \item Designed statistical techniques to combine individual physical measurements made by several analysis groups to decrease overall uncertainty
        \item Wrote C++ code to analyze thousands of live collissions per second to determine which should be recorded to disk
        \item Wrote C++/python code to analyze rare top-quark events to constrain theoretical physical models
        \item Enforced coding standards, conventions, and practices across a large C++ code base within our experiment
