	\textbf{Fellowship} \hfill \emph{2013}\\
        Insight Data Science
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Created a web app using Flask, Bootstrap, and jquery that implements a probabilistic recommendation algorithm to suggest chains of similar, nearby restaurants and bars \\
        \item Used Python libraries to implement a similarity ranking based on latent semantic analysis \\
        \item Built a probabilistic model combining semantic similarity, distance, and user reviews to rank nearby venues \\
        \item Scraped online magazine reviews from websites and combined with location and user information from Foursquare API using Python \\
        \item Deployed site to Heroku using MongoDB to store data and Amazon S3 to host the trained algorithm \\
%        \item Used Python libraries to build similarity algorithm a markov chain based on latent semantic analysis \\
%        \item Used MongoDB to store and query data obtained from public apis and web scraping \\
%        \item Developed on the web using Flask, Jinja, Bootstrap, and jquery\\

	\textbf{Graduate Research} \hfill \emph{2008 - 2013}\\
	New York University and The European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) \\
        Member of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) \\

        \medskip

        \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed statistical modeling and analysis software used extensively throughout a 3000 person experiment
        \item Used a parallel analysis architecture to analyze petabytes of data distributed over a worldwide grid of data centers
        \item Designed and implemented statistical techniques to combine physical measurements made independently by several analysis groups to decrease overall uncertainty
        \item Wrote highly optimized C++ code to classify which of millions of collisions per second to permanently store for later analysis
        \item Wrote C++/python code to analyze rare top-quark events that are used to constrain theoretical physical models
        \item Enforced coding standards, conventions, and best practices across a large C++ and Python code base
        \item Recipient of National Science Foundation US LHC Graduate Student Support Award
        \item Taught Quantum Mechanics (graduate), Quarks to the Cosmos, and General Physics (undergraduate)

        \begin{itemize}
          \item Used x-rays to study the chemical and orbital structure of heavy metal elements (uranium, plutonium)
          \item Aided in design and construction of experimental equipment
          \item Performed and monitored data collection at the Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC)
