    \item Founded the Risk and Analytics Team, later the Data Science Team.  Designed and implemented the risk and underwriting program, growing company's loan portfolio by a factor of 200 while decreasing loss rates and achieving unit profitability.  Led the team from seed round funding through series B. \\

    \item Designed, trained, deployed, and monitored statistical models using logistic regression, generalized additive models, decision trees, and random forests to evaluate the credit risk of all applicants and to identify and mitigate fraud. \\

    \item Built and leveraged analytics capabilities to ensure model accuracy, to track business metrics, to reveal trends in the loan portfolio, and to uncover opportunities for the risk program. % uncover customer insights. % Continuously analyzed risk program and loan portfolio to ensure model accuracy, to track business metrics, and uncover  \\

    \item Grew the Data Science Team to more than 10 members. Established best practices for building statistical models and performing analytics.  Enforced high software standards and helped develop a culture of strong programming practices within the Data Science Team. \\

    \item Built production-quality software in Java, Python, and Clojure to implement the risk program, serve and score models statistical models, and to ingest and process data in real time. \\

    \item Recruited and trained the original Data Engineering Team.  Collaborated with Data Engineering Team to build an ETL framework, jobs, and pipelines for supporting machine learning and analytics using Python, Scala, Airflow and Spark.  Developed tooling to enable streamlined model deployment for data scientists. \\

        \begin{itemize}

        \item National Science Foundation US LHC Graduate Student Support Award recipient.

          %% ttbar analysis
        \item Built sophisticated models using custom likelihood functions and modern frequentist inference techniques to produce world accurate measurements of fundamental particle properties.

          %% HistFactory + RooStats
        \item Developed and maintained a statistical framework in C++ that implemented novel modeling techniques and was used extensively throughout a 3,000 person collaboration.

         %% PROOF + SFRAME + Grid
        \item Used parallel batch computing to analyze petabytes of data distributed worldwide across data centers.

         %%
        \item Wrote production C++ code to select interesting collisions of the 10 million created per second.

         %% Code clean-up
        \item Enforced coding standards, conventions, and best practices across a large C++ and Python code base.
